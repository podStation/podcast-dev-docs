# Lightning Network

Lightning Network is a _Layer 2_ payment protocol that works on top of blockchain based crypto currencies using smart contracts[^lightning-network-wikipedia].

Lightning currently supports Bitcoin and Litecoin as currencies, but Bitcoin has a higher adoption.

As part of the [Podcasting 2.0](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/podcasting2.0.md) initiative, monetization based on the Lightning Network was proposed.

## Status

Although it is already supported by a number of hosting platforms and applications, monetization with Lightning Network is still considered **experimental**.

## Use cases

Monetization with Lightning Network, at its current state, is used only for the _value for value_ model.

In this model, listeners decide how much (monetary) value the listening experience has.

Users typically pledge to pay a certain amount for the time listened for each podcast, normally expressed in _satoshis[^satoshi] per minute_.

[^satoshi]: 1 Satoshi = 1/100 000 000 Bitcoins, it is the smallest bitcoin unit that can be represented in the bitcoin network ledger. Reference: [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Units_and_divisibility) Wikipedia Article, section _Units and divisibility_

## Advantages

There are some aspects of the Lightning Network that make it attractive as a technology for podcast monetization:

- **Decentralized** - Lightning payments are _peer-to-peer_. Although they may depend on a middle man (for routing payments), the middle man can be any participant of the network, not a central entity. This means that the podcaster cannot be "deplatformed" from a central monetization platform such as _Patreon_ or _PayPal_;
- **Based on open standards** - The fact that the Lightning Network is based on an open standard means that, to a certain extent[^lightning-open-standard-note], the used software can be replaced, avoiding vendor lock-in
- **Fast** - As the name suggests, Lightning payments are nearly instantaneous
- **Allows micropayments**[^wikipedia-micropayment] - Lightning payments can be done with very small amounts (i.e. down to millisatoshis for Bitcoin payments)
- **Low fees** - Once the channels are setup, payments can be done with low (or event zero) fees

[^lightning-open-standard-note]: Although the lightning nodes use an open standard to participate on the network, the APIs to communicate with the nodes are not standardized and vary from node to node.

## Disadvantages

Exchanging _fiat money_ into crypto currencies and allocating the crypto in the Lightning Network does have considerable fees. It can also be a difficult process, depending on the setup (i.e. if the participants want to operate their own Lightning Nodes).

## Specification

The specification for monetization with Lightning Network is covered in the specification for the `podcast:value` tag of the _podcast namespace_. This specification can be found [here](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md).
