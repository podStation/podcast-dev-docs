# Overview

This collection of documents is primarily aimed at Software Developers building software on the podcast ecosystem.

It is being written at the moment to support the development of [podStation](https://podstation.github.io/), but it is aimed as a general resource, not only targeting podcast clients (also known as aggregators).

!!! Warning
    This content does not contain a Licence at the moment, as I have not decided which one to use yet.

    I am leaning towards MIT. Suggestions and feedback is welcome.
